# Summer-Java-Final-Project
* This repository contains the code for my COP2800 final project, which is a simple projectile motion simulator.
  
* The simulator allows you to change the values for initial speed, angle, and gravity that the projectile is launched with.
  
* Other controls that are implemented in the simulator include a undo button, a reset button, a slow motion checkbox, and a checkbox that when checked, displays the launch values for initial speed, angle, and gravity that the projectile was launched with onto the projectile.
